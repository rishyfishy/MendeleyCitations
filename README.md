# MendeleyCitations
Simple Code to find which references you haven't yet used in Mendeley.

Say you have a folder in Mendeley with 200 documents. This folder was created for a research paper. You're nearing the end of the paper, and you realize you've only used 150 documents. There's no easy way to find which 50 documents you missed! I made some python code to solve that problem, and I will soon be doing the same in C++ and creating a .exe file.

Please feel free to use this tool to help with your research!

How to use: 
1. Create a file named "Mendeley.txt" in the same file as the ipnyb
2. Copy the formatted citations from Mendeley into the text file.
3. Create another text file named "wordReferences.txt" and copy your bibliography from word into the text file. 
4. Run all the cells in citations.ipnyb
5. You will be left with a list of citations from mendeley of papers you haven't yet used in your paper!
